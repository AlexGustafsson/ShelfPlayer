#  Audiobooks for Audiobookshelf

This is a [Audiobookshelf](https://www.audiobookshelf.org) client written in Swift. Its purpose is to feel native on all Apple Devices it runs at (currently iPhones, maybe Apple Watch?). Feel free to take a look at screenshots [here](https://github.com/rasmuslos/audiobooks/tree/master/Screenshots). It currently supports audiobooks & podcasts.

## How to get it
Because it is expensive I am not a member of the apple developer program. If you want to use this app you will have to build it yourself using XCode. A tutorial from apple is available [here](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/building-and-running-an-app).

## Development
This app is built using SwiftUI, CoreData and SwiftPM. Just clone the repository and open the XCode project.
